# APED QA — E2E & Integration Test Generation

Generate comprehensive end-to-end and integration tests for completed stories or epics. Complements the unit tests written during /aped-dev TDD.

## Setup

1. Read `.aped/config.yaml` — extract config
2. Read `docs/state.yaml` — find completed stories/epics
3. Read `.aped/aped-qa/references/test-patterns.md` for framework selection and test templates

## Scope Selection

Ask the user:
1. **What to test?** — specific story, full epic, or all completed work
2. **Test type?** — E2E (user journeys), Integration (API/service), or Both

## Story/Epic Analysis

For the selected scope:
1. Read story files from `docs/stories/`
2. Extract all Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
3. Map user journeys across stories (multi-step flows)
4. Identify integration points (APIs, databases, external services)

## Task Tracking

```
TaskCreate: "Analyze stories and extract ACs"
TaskCreate: "Generate E2E tests"
TaskCreate: "Generate integration tests"
TaskCreate: "Run and verify all tests"
TaskCreate: "Write QA report"
```

## Test Generation

Launch **2 Agent tool calls in parallel**:

### Agent 1: E2E Tests (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`)

For each user journey that spans one or more stories:

1. Map the full flow: entry → steps → expected outcome
2. Generate test using the project's test framework
3. Each AC's Given/When/Then becomes a test step
4. Include:
   - Happy path (main flow)
   - Error paths (invalid input, unauthorized, not found)
   - Edge cases (empty data, concurrent access, timeouts)

### Agent 2: Integration Tests (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`)

For each integration point:

1. Test request/response contracts
2. Test error handling (service down, timeout, malformed response)
3. Test data consistency (DB state before/after)
4. Test authentication/authorization boundaries

Once both agents return, update tasks to `completed`.

### Test Naming Convention

```
{test-type}/{epic-slug}/{story-slug}.test.{ext}
```

## Framework Detection

Read project config to auto-detect:
- **Node.js**: Playwright, Cypress, or Puppeteer for E2E; Supertest for API
- **Python**: Pytest + httpx for API; Playwright for E2E
- **Go**: Go test + httptest for API
- **Rust**: reqwest for API tests

Use `bash .aped/aped-dev/scripts/run-tests.sh` to verify tests pass.

## Test Coverage Report

After generation:
- List ACs covered vs uncovered
- List user journeys tested
- List integration points tested
- Flag any untestable ACs (and why)

## Output

1. Write tests to project test directory (detect convention)
2. Write QA report to `docs/qa-report.md`:
   - Stories tested
   - Tests generated (count by type)
   - Coverage gaps
   - Manual test suggestions (for things that can't be automated)

## No State Change

QA doesn't affect pipeline state — it's an additive quality layer.

## Next Steps

Suggest running `/aped-status` to view updated sprint status with QA coverage noted.

## Example

Epic 1 completed (3 stories) → generate QA:
- E2E: 5 tests covering registration → login → dashboard journey
- Integration: 3 API tests for auth endpoints
- Report: 8/8 ACs covered, 0 gaps, 1 manual test suggested (email verification)

## Common Issues

- **Test framework not detected**: Check project config — ensure test runner is in dependencies
- **ACs not testable**: Some ACs describe UX behavior — flag as "manual test required" in report
- **Tests fail on generated code**: Review the test — it may assume a specific API shape. Adapt to actual implementation
